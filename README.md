Note that this assumes you are working with a mac. For those on Windows, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed (you want the version of pip from Python 3, 
which might mean using the command ```pip3``` instead of ```pip```).

```
pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

Add the following to your bash_profile:
```
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```
